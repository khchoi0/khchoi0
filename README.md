### Hi there, I am Ka Hou CHOI. ðŸ‘‹

Keen on digging into the logic behind things, would feel satisfied when works finished thoroughly.
My dream career is trying to be one in teams which build contributing tools for the society
and at the same time preventing disasters brought by the tools I would have built.
